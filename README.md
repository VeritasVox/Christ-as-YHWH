# Christ-as-YHWH
A systematic defense of Christ as YHWH aimed more towards JW error. It anticipates their defenses in Reasoning from The Scriptures and avoids common verses they are well prepared to defend against (e.g. John 1:1). It also demonstrates two of the three persons of the Godhead without discussing "trinity".
